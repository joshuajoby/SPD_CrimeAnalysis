📌 CrimeRegion – Crime News Information Portal
📖 Project Overview

CrimeRegion is a web-based application that collects crime-related news from public news sources and presents it in a structured and user-friendly format. The system processes unstructured news articles to identify key information such as crime type, location, and credibility using rule-based logic. The application aims to help users quickly understand crime-related incidents and trends without manually analyzing multiple news articles.

This project is developed for academic and educational purposes, demonstrating practical applications of web development, data processing, and rule-based text analysis.
